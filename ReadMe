Overview
    This Flashcards App is a Python-based GUI application that allows users to create, manage, and study flashcard sets. The app utilizes Tkinter and ttkbootstrap for the user interface and SQLite for storing flashcard data. The app supports creating new flashcard sets, adding cards to sets, browsing through the sets, and using "learn mode" to flip through flashcards for study purposes.

Features
    Create Flashcard Sets: Users can create sets of flashcards, adding words and their definitions.
    View Flashcards: Users can select an existing flashcard set and view its contents.
    Learn Mode: Users can flip through flashcards one by one, revealing the definition of each word.
    Delete Flashcard Sets: Users can delete existing sets from the database.
    Data Persistence: Flashcard sets and cards are stored in a local SQLite database.
Requirements
    Python 3.x
    SQLite (comes pre-installed with Python)
    Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
    ttkbootstrap (pip install ttkbootstrap)

    Database Structure
    The app uses an SQLite database (flashcards.db) with two tables:

        flashcard_sets: Stores the names of the flashcard sets.

            id (INTEGER): Primary key.
            name (TEXT): Name of the flashcard set.
        flashcards: Stores individual flashcards.

            id (INTEGER): Primary key.
            set_id (INTEGER): Foreign key referencing flashcard_sets.
            word (TEXT): The word on the flashcard.
            definition (TEXT): The definition of the word.
Additional Notes
        The ttkbootstrap library enhances the default Tkinter widgets, providing a modern look and feel to the application.
        All user data, including flashcard sets and cards, is stored persistently in the flashcards.db database.
        Future Enhancements
Potential improvements include:
        Implementing a quiz mode to test knowledge of flashcards.
        Adding the ability to edit flashcards after they are created.
        Integrating search functionality to easily find flashcards by word.
